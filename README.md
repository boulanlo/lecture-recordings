# M2 MoSIG Lecture recordings
A small repo using Git LFS to store recordings of some of the lectures
of M2 MoSIG. Each video is uploaded in two different qualities so that
people with a poor internet connexion can still get the lectures in
a reasonable amount of time.

# Important
I was made aware that GitHub only allows 1GB of maximum bandwidth on LFS files.
If somehow the download isn't allowed anymore from Github, I included a Renater
File Sender for each lecture file. Sorry for the inconvenience.
